Welcome to our TowerDef VR Game

Preparation Phase:
Build and upgrade your defense.

Attack Phase:
Enemies will start spawning and moving towards your base.
Your towers will automatically attack the enemies as they come into range.
You cannot build or upgrade towers during this phase, so make sure your setup is ready!

Game Layout:
Enemies run from spawn (green) to base (blue) on a given path (red).
Each round, the base moves further back, increasing the challenge.
Enemy stats and timer increases over the time.

Objective:
Prevent the enemies from reaching your base. If too many enemies get through, you will lose the game.

As the commander of the defense forces, you have several crucial abilities at your disposal in this tower defense game:

Tower Placement: Strategically position towers to defend key points along the enemy's path.
Tower Management: Upgrade and fine-tune your towers to optimize their effectiveness against increasingly formidable enemies.
Direct Combat Support: Engage directly by shooting to assist towers, especially during critical moments when enemies threaten to breach defenses.
If you are defeated in battle, you will be temporarily frozen until you respawn, preventing you from participating actively until then.

Your objective is clear: protect the base by skillfully managing your towers and engaging enemies with strategic precision.
